      "name": "Monstera Deliciosa",
      "commonName": "Swiss Cheese Plant",
      "funFact": "The name Monstera deliciosa is derived from the Latin word monstrosus, meaning monstrous, and the Spanish word delicioso, meaning delicious.",
      "funFact2": " The plant was named by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, who described it as a monstrous plant with delicious fruit.The fruit tastes like a combination of pineapple, banana, and mango! However, it's not as simple as just picking the fruit and eating it. The fruit is only ripe and safe to eat once it has fallen off the plant and started to decompose on the ground. Legend has it that the indigenous people of Central and South America used to tie the ripe fruit to a stick and leave it out in the sun to rot until it was soft and mushy. Then, they would use the stick to scoop out the delicious fruit from the inside. So, while Monstera deliciosa is most commonly grown as a houseplant for its ornamental leaves, it's also a tasty treat for those who are willing to put in a bit of effort to enjoy its fruit!",

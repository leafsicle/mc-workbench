          I have always been incessantly curious. As I have gotten older the
          size and scale of projects I have dismantled and reassembled have
          grown substantially; From taking apart my toys to figure out why the
          noise stopped coming from them to stripping down my dryer because it
          was making an unusual noise.

          Over the last year, I took the time to earn my Masters degree in
          cybersecurity from the University of Maryland Baltimore County. During
          the course of study, I earned a 4.0 GPA while also earning a
          certificate in Digital Forensics. These courses have served to widen
          my knowledge base for the current technology trends and enhanced my
          ability to investigate common programming difficulties. I was an
          unfortunate victim of layoffs due to Covid pandemic in June of 2020
          from my job as a fullstack developer and nobody was hiring so I took
          advantage of a sabbatical.

          When in I previously employed as a developer, I bolstered my general
          programming knowledge by taking classes that taught Python, SQL, and
          C# at the local community college. I earned a certificate in web
          development from the Suncoast Developerâ€™s Guild in St. Petersburg,
          Florida in 2018. While attending the bootcamp we were taught the
          fundamentals of developing web applications, the importance of
          accessibility, and the flow of web requests. Prior to that, I was in
          the US Army and was serving as an All-Source Intelligence Analyst
          where I functioned as a Special Security Representative for our
          on-site Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) as well as
          a physical security manager. My academic accomplishments demonstrate
          that I have an unbridled passion for the work that I do and I would
          love to put that to work building and learning alongside your company.

          I have always been incessantly curious. As I have gotten older the
          size and scale of projects I have dismantled and reassembled have
          grown substantially. From taking apart my toys to figure out why the
          noise stopped coming from them to stripping down my dryer because it
          was making an unusual noise.

          I recently earned my Masters degree in cybersecurity from the
          University of Maryland Baltimore County earning a 4.0 GPA. These
          courses have served to widen my knowledge base for the current
          technology trends and enhanced my ability to investigate common
          programming difficulties. I was an unfortunate victim of layoffs due
          to Covid pandemic in June of 2020 from my job as a fullstack developer
          and nobody was hiring so I took advantage of a sabbatical.

          When in I previously employed as a developer, I bolstered my general
          programming knowledge by taking classes that taught Python, SQL, and
          C# at the local community college. I earned a certificate in web
          development from the Suncoast Developerâ€™s Guild in St. Petersburg,
          Florida in 2018. While attending the bootcamp we were taught the
          fundamentals of developing web applications, the importance of
          accessibility. Prior to that, I was in the US Army and was serving as
          an All-Source Intelligence Analyst. My academic accomplishments
          demonstrate that I have an unbridled passion for the work that I do.

        I recently earned my Masters degree in Cybersecurity. I try to always
        envision the larger picture. I favor accessible and responsive designs
        that are cleanly written. responsive design clean code languages I
        earned a certificate in web development from the Suncoast Developerâ€™s
        Guild in St. Petersburg, FL in 2018. Prior to that, I was in the US Army
        and was serving as an All-Source Intelligence Analyst. My academic
        accomplishments demonstrate that I have an unbridled passion for the
        work that I do.

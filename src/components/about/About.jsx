        <h3>Insatiable Curiosity</h3>
        <p>
          Curiosity has been the driving force behind my personal and
          professional growth. From a young age, I've been compelled to
          understand how things work, often by taking them apart and putting
          them back together. As I've grown, so has the complexity of my
          projects.
